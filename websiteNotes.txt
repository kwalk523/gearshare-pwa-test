GearShare website notes:

added image - doesn't show anything

creating filters in the search category

still need to be able to take pictures to document Pickup condition

making sure that once an item is rented, it is removed from the market

how to return gear once it's the borrowing period has ended

tabs 'Lend Gear', 'My Rentals', and 'My Listings' dont work

Deposit Amount - unsure of what to do with this. currently, user listing item can change this.

When listing in Lend Gear, image doesn't appear. Noteworthy, price doesn't show (might not be a big deal if we show it in the Browse Gear tab.
 - when listing gear, the item doesn't appear in the Browse Gear Tab.
 - a potential solution could be linking our gear_image table in supabase correctly?
 - when listing user should be able to select the dates they plan on lending, this should also be reflected in the Browse Gear section too.
